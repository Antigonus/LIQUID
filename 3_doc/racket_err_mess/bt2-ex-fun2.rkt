I have a related question.  I turned on error trace using the command line Robby
suggested, but it doesn't give me a full trace.  Here is an example below, the
trace should be f -> gg -> g -> hh -> h then bang, the error.   But instead
Racket shows me f -> + bang,  "in context of h".  But which 'h'?

How do you turn on tracing?  If I go interactive is there a command which will
give me the trace?


;; bt2-ex-fun2.rkt:
;;
  #lang racket

  (define (h x y) (+ x y))

  (define (hh x y) (h x y))

  (define (f x y)
    (gg x y)
    )

  (define (gg x y) 
    (define z 7)
    (set! z (h 5 0))
    (g (- x z) y)
    )

  (define zz 5)

  (define (g x y)
    (hh (+ x (h zz 0)) y)
    )

  (f 3 5)
  (f 3 'a)
